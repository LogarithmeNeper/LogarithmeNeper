## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my GitHub profile, mainly for personal projects and things I like to do in my spare time.

   <ul>
    <li> My username was chosen when I heard about logarithms for the first time, which was a convenient way (for me) to get rid of useless powers in functions. I am not really sure why that trick had such an effect on me, yet it was great so I decided to name me like that. Apart from that, my real name is Pierre, I completed my M.Sc. in Computer Science and I am looking forward to do a Ph.D.</li>
    <li>I also work in Philosophy in UniversitÃ© Jean Moulin Lyon 3, with a dissertation revolving around abstraction principles (in the way Peano's school and Frege both defined it) and creative definitions <em>Ã  la</em> Weyl. This work revolves around the very concept of defining new objects upon an equivalence relation, and some philosophical and technical problems that may be hidden there.</li>
